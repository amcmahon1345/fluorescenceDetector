# fluorescenceDetector

The body and lid of the printable fluorescence detection device were designed using Autodesk Fusion, sliced using Bambu Studio, and printed on a Bambu lab X1e 3D printer using a 0.4 mm nozzle and a 0.2 mm layer height. Designs for these components are available via Github.
Illumination was provided by a cyan PowerStar LED (OSLON Pure 1010) with a Lisa Series 15° spot beam optic, filtered using a Thorlabs premium bandpass filter, CWL = 488 nm. 
Emitted fluorescence was filtered by a Thorlabs premium bandpass filter, CWL = 520 nm and imaged by a Raspberry Pi HQ camera through a Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera Lens, 6mm angle.
Bespoke, open-source software running on a Raspberry Pi 4 controlled the device.  

A full parts list, circuit diagram, image of detector, workflow and 3d image file for 3D printing are available on this Github.
